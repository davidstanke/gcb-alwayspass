Example of a Cloud Build config with a step that will always succeed

*Update 2019-07*: Added [fail-build.cloudbuild.yaml](fail-build.cloudbuild.yaml), which causes Cloud Build to treat the overall build as failed if the "always pass" step fails.

(thanks to [jglick](https://github.com/jglick) whose [Simple Maven Project with Tests](https://github.com/jglick/simple-maven-project-with-tests) is the example code)
